## Web developer experience 

*My journey in IT started with web design
because before that I was fond of Adobe Photoshop CS6 and knew it at a good level so it seemed to me that I would quickly enter the specialty.But after completing the 'Web Design 2.0' course, numerous intensives on YouTube (and even created 4 layouts), I realized that it was boring and not for me.
I think it was a rewarding experience and now I can easily interact with a web designer on any project and also be able to make any edits if needed.
Programs in which I worked: Adobe photoshop CC, figma and similar.
After my history with web design, I clearly decided that I wanted to do front-end development and due to my inexperience I thought that it included HTML, CSS, responsive layout and jQuery plugins, so the first course I took on openedu.ru was "Web programming", which only studied HTML and CSS. Then I started taking courses from the author Vadim Prokopchuk “Website layout from 0 to 1”, “Website layout from scratch” and there I used in a real project: BEM, Gulp, Git, preprocessors, js, therefore realizing that front-end development is much wider.* 
**Now my biggest goal and dream is to become a good front-end developer and later a full-stack developer.**

**Course Completion Certificate JavaScript:** v.2.0 https://itgid.info/certificate/view?Certificate%5Buid%5D=d7q61n77qn

**By clicking on the address, you can see my first layout project:** www.romanjhyltsou.ru, 
using jQuery plugins and adaptive layout, which I implemented using media queries.

**Skills:**
HTML5, CSS3,
preprocessors SASS, BEM — A CSS Naming Convention, Flexbox,
Mobile(media queries),
JavaScript Basics, jQuery plugins and other plugins like Swiper js,
GitHub
VS Code
Adobe Photoshop,PSD, Sketch, Figma, Zeplin, Adobe XD

**Sample code from codewars:**

 `function killer (suspectInfo, dead) { `
```for(let key in suspectInfo){
      if(dead.every(item => suspectInfo[key].includes(item))){
          return key;
      }
  }
  
}

killer({'James': ['Jacob', 'Bill', 'Lucas'], 'Johnny': ['David', 'Kyle', 'Lucas'],
'Peter': ['Lucy', 'Kyle']}, ['Lucas', 'Bill']); //, 'James');
killer({'Brad': [], 'Megan': ['Ben', 'Kevin'], 'Finn': []}, ['Ben']); //, 'Megan'); */
