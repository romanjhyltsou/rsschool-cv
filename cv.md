## Work experience

## Web developer experience 

*My journey into IT began with web design, which gave me a deep understanding of how front-end developers collaborate with designers and UI/UX specialists. During my training, I mastered Adobe Photoshop CC, Figma, and other tools, which allow me to easily make design adjustments and adapt layouts for implementation. This experience developed my attention to detail and ability to balance visual aesthetics with technical execution.

Later, I decided to focus on interface development and completed courses in HTML, CSS, responsive layout, and JavaScript. During my studies, I learned modern development methodologies such as BEM, preprocessors (SASS/LESS), the Gulp build system, and version control with Git. As I continued to expand my knowledge, I delved deeper into JavaScript and began learning React.js to develop complex interfaces.

I enjoy finding unconventional solutions to challenging problems, working in a team, building effective communication with colleagues, and quickly adapting to new technologies.*

**Sample code from codewars:**

function killer (suspectInfo, dead) { 
  for(let key in suspectInfo){
      if(dead.every(item => suspectInfo[key].includes(item))){
          return key;
      }
  }
  
}

killer({'James': ['Jacob', 'Bill', 'Lucas'], 'Johnny': ['David', 'Kyle', 'Lucas'],
'Peter': ['Lucy', 'Kyle']}, ['Lucas', 'Bill']); //, 'James');
killer({'Brad': [], 'Megan': ['Ben', 'Kevin'], 'Finn': []}, ['Ben']); //, 'Megan');
